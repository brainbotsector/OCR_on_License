# OCR_on_License
This Python project uses EasyOCR and OpenCV for (OCR) on images in the "Original Images" folder. It processes images, detects text, draws bounding boxes, and saves modified images in the "After OCR Images" folder. The script prints processing status, making it a quick and automated tool for enhancing images with recognized text.
